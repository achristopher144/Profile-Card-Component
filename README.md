Overview:
This challenge was originally fairly difficult, as I have mainly only done walkthroughs and tutorials,
but after breaking the code down into individual components and writing code accordingly it started 
to really flow.

The challenge:
Copy the image as  best you can using what you know.

What I used to build:
Built with Virtual Studio Code using CSS3 and HTML5

What I learned:
I learned how to implement background images and how to position them, 
as well as using positioning in a dynamic context.
